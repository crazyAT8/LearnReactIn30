Universal Unique Identifier (UUID)


UUID stands for Universal Unique Identifier. 
It is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. 
The size and method of generating the UUID ensure that it is unique 
    not just within a specific database or application but across multiple systems, networks, and locations, 
        making it ideal for ensuring the uniqueness of identifiers across large-scale distributed systems.

The structure of a UUID is standardized by the RFC 4122     
    and can represent a very large number of unique identifiers (about 3.4 Ã— 10^38 unique values). 
UUIDs are used in various applications 
    and services where unique identifiers are needed, 
        such as in the creation of database keys, 
            to identify sessions in web applications, 
                for tracking unique user interactions, 
                    and in many other contexts where unique identifiers are required 
                        without central coordination or registration.

UUIDs can be generated using various algorithms, 
    which ensures that even without a centralized authority to issue them, 
        collisions (two generated UUIDs being the same) are extremely improbable. 
Some of the standard methods include 
    using the MAC address of the computer that generates the UUID, 
        the current time, or purely random numbers, 
            depending on the version of the UUID being generated.
