[19:30] - useEffect

If you refresh the browser 
    notice that our Todos aren't showing up
        they are not being persisted across page load 
            we want to store these inside local storage 
    
Easiest way to do things that are a side effect 
    ex: everytime that we add a Todo 
        we want to save it 
            we can us the useEffect hook 

- src > App.js 
    add just below useRef 
        useEffect is just a function 
            that will take another function as it's first parameter  
                and this is the function we want to do things 
                everytime something changes we want to call this function 
                    how we determine when to call this function 
                        is that we pass it an array of properties 
                        this array will be all of our dependencies
                            anytime that anything in this array changes 
                                we want to use the useEffect function 
                                    so anytime our [todos] changes 
                                        we want to save our todos 
            going to save them to localStorage
                with a .setItem attached 
                    and give it a key
                        need to create a variable for it 
    outside of the App() function 
        create " const LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY = 'todoApp.todos' "
            pass that variable name into setItem 
                and also pass it a string to stingify our todos 

                useEffect(() => {
                    localStorage.setItem(LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(todos))
                }, [todos]) 

- Local Browser 
    add some todos to the list and refresh 
        but they still aren't showing up 
            this is bc we need to use another effect 

- src > App.js 
    App() function 
        below the todoNameRef variable 
            add another useEffect function 
                this one will be called to load our todos 
                    just once right when our component loads 
                        if we pass it an empty array of dependencies
                            it will call the function once 
                                and since the empty array never changes 
                                it will never recall this useEffect 
            want to set this useEffect function 
                to what we get back from our stored todos 
                    by creating a variable for storedTodos 
                    having it equal localStorage.getItem(LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY) 
                        then we want to set our Todos to the stored todos 
                            only if we have stored todos 
                            add a conditional if statement
                    but we will get an error 
                        bc item we are getting from local storage is a string 
                            so we need to parse this with JSON 
                                which will convert it to an array
                        
                useEffect(() => {
                    const storedTodos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY))
                    if (storedTodos) setTodos(storedTodos)
                }, [])
