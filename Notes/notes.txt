title: Learn React In 30 Minutes

[:55] Get started
- open vs code
    inside a blank folder 
        with no capital letters and no spaces
- checked the npm version
    w/ 'npm -v'

- then created the app w/
    'npx create-react-app .'
        if you use a period at the end
            the app will be named after the folder that the program is already in 
            just make sure it doesn't have any capital letters
                thats a no no, I guess
- src > index.js
    we are feeding the ReactDOM the App.js function 'App()'

- npm start 
    to bring the app up in a development environment

- scr > index.js
    which is at the top of the src folder
        it renders the content we pass into it 
            at a certain element of in the index.html file 
                which is in our public folder

- src > App.js 
    Remove/strip everything down to the bare bones
        go ahead and remove the boiler plate code 
            within the app function 
                and just have it return null
        as well as the other import statements
            except import React from 'react'
- src folder 
    remove all of the files except 
        App.js and index.js 
- src > index.js 
    remove everything except for the React, ReactDOM, and App imports 
        and the ReactDOM root render 
            should just show you a blank white page 



- write the html for the app
