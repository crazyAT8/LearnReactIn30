- you are always going to start with your App componenet
    bc this is the root of your application

- src > App.js
    write the HTML inside of our app component
        inside of the return of the App() function 
    
    first return is a seperate component we create 
        called <TodoList />
            as the first element inside of our application
        now this is not standard HTML 
            its actually JSX - React's HTML 
                which will allow you to embed components inside other components
                    for instance 
                        we have our <App /> component in our index.js 
                        and we have our <TodoList /> in our App.js

- src > create new file named after the component we just created 
    'TodoList.js'

SideNote:
    VS code extension 'ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets'
        needs to be installed 
            with this installed we can type 
                'rfc' + ENTER at the top of the new file 
                    and it will create a function component inside of React
                        giving it the name of the file 

- src > App.js 
    import TodoList from './TodoList'
        which is giving the App() the TodoList component 
            
- src > TodoList.js 
    type something inside the <div> tags 
        to make sure it's working 

- src > App.js 
    create the input for adding a new todo 
        <input type="text" />
            and we will get an ERROR from this 
                bc you can't have two JSX elements next to each other 
                inside of a return 
                    bc the return can only return one thing
