[25:35] - count the uncomplete 

Now lets make the last div in our App() reutrn 
    tell us how many todos are unchecked 

- src > App.js 
    in the return 
        the <div> at the bottom 
            we need to run a filter on the todos 
                and pass in all of the ones that aren't complete 

                ' <div>{todos.filter(todo => !todo.complete).length} left to do</div> '
